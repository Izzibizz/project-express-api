# Project Express API

This project is about creating a API using Exress.js for the first time. The choice of API was free and it was possible to also create a frontend using the deployed data. 

## The problem
I created my own API using ChatGpt and added some hand picked images representing the art to make sure I was happy with the visual. It was quite handy, also to be able to ask Chatgpt to update the whole list with whether the artist is alive or not, to not have to go through it one by one. 

This was the first backend project, and therefore the methods were quite new, but since the project was still quite small in complexity it was easily manageble and was more like an introduction.
